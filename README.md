# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors: package.json and Dependencies

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using the Expo CLI. The error is related to inconsistencies or problems within the project's `package.json` file or its dependencies. While Expo typically provides helpful error messages, this specific issue often presents vaguely, requiring a thorough examination of the project's dependencies.

The `bug.js` file shows an example project with a problematic dependency setup, leading to the error.  The `bugSolution.js` file offers a solution by correcting the dependency configuration.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Attempt to run `expo start`.  Observe the error.
4. Apply the fix from `bugSolution.js` to `package.json`.
5. Run `expo start` again to confirm the solution.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter a similar, vaguely described Expo CLI error, follow these steps:

* **Check `package.json`:** Verify all dependencies are correctly specified and versions are compatible.
* **`npm install` or `yarn install`:** Ensure dependencies are properly installed using your package manager.
* **Check Expo SDK Version:** Make sure your Expo SDK version is compatible with your dependencies and other project settings.
* **Clear Cache:** Try clearing the Expo cache using `expo prebuild --clean`.
* **Examine Log Files:** Carefully review the Expo CLI's output for hints related to dependency conflicts or version incompatibilities.
