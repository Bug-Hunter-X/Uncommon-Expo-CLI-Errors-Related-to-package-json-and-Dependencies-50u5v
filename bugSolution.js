The solution involves carefully reviewing the `package.json` file's dependencies section.  Look for version conflicts or missing dependencies that might cause the Expo CLI to fail.  Also, make sure all dependencies are listed correctly and compatibly. The `bug.js` contains a sample `package.json` that includes the issue.  The `bugSolution.js` contains the corrected `package.json`.  A common mistake is an incompatibility between React Native's version and the version of other libraries used in the project.
